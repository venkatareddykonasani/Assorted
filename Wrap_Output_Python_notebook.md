This Python code snippet is designed for use in an IPython (Interactive Python) environment, such as a Jupyter notebook. Its purpose is to modify the display settings for `<pre>` elements, ensuring that text within them wraps instead of overflowing. This can make outputs, particularly those with long lines of text or code, easier to read by avoiding the need to scroll horizontally. Let's break down the code:

```python
# Import HTML and display functions from IPython.display module.
# These functions are used for displaying HTML within an IPython environment.
from IPython.display import HTML, display

# Define a function named wrap_display with no parameters.
def wrap_display():
  # Inside the function, the display function is called with an HTML object.
  # This HTML object contains a style tag that targets <pre> elements, setting
  # their white-space property to pre-wrap. This CSS property makes the text
  # within <pre> elements wrap inside the container.
  display(HTML('''
  <style>
    pre {
        white-space: pre-wrap;
    }
  </style>
  '''))

# get_ipython() is called to get the current IPython instance.
# .events.register is then used on this instance to register the wrap_display
# function as an event handler for the 'pre_run_cell' event.
# This means that before any cell is run, the wrap_display function will be executed,
# applying the CSS styling to <pre> elements.
get_ipython().events.register('pre_run_cell', wrap_display)
```

### Key Components:
- **IPython.display.HTML**: This is used to create an instance of an HTML object that contains the HTML code to be rendered.
- **IPython.display.display()**: This function is used to display the HTML object created by `HTML()`.
- **get_ipython().events.register**: This part of the IPython API allows you to register a callback function to be triggered by specific events in the IPython lifecycle. Here, it's used to ensure that `wrap_display` is called before any cell in the notebook is executed (`'pre_run_cell'` event).

### Purpose:
The primary purpose of this code is to enhance the readability of output in Jupyter notebooks or other IPython interfaces by ensuring long lines of text wrap within the viewport. This can be particularly useful when working with data outputs or error messages that exceed the width of the notebook's cells, as it prevents the need for horizontal scrolling to read the full line of text.

### Usage:
This script is particularly useful in Jupyter notebooks where you might be displaying outputs that include long lines of text or code. By automatically wrapping text, it improves the readability and user experience within the notebook environment.
